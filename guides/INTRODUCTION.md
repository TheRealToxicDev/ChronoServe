## What is SysManix?

SysManix is a secure, cross-platform service management API that provides controlled access to system services through a RESTful interface. It bridges the gap between system administration and application management by offering a standardized way to interact with system services across different operating systems.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both Windows and Linux systems
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Service Management**: Start, stop, and monitor services through a consistent API
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of all operations and access attempts
- **Protected Service Safety**: Built-in protection for critical system services
- **RESTful API**: Clean, well-documented API for easy integration

## Why Use SysManix?

### For DevOps Teams

- **Automation**: Integrate service management into your automation workflows
- **Standardization**: Use the same API calls regardless of underlying OS
- **Security**: Fine-grained access control for service operations
- **Monitoring**: Track service status and logs programmatically

### For System Administrators

- **Remote Management**: Control services remotely through a secure API
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all service operations
- **Permission Control**: Delegate limited access to services without giving full system access
- **Safety Measures**: Protection against accidental modification of critical services

### For Developers

- **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use REST API for incorporating service management
- **Consistent Interface**: Abstract away OS-specific service management differences
- **Detailed Documentation**: Well-documented endpoints and operations
- **Flexible Authentication**: JWT-based auth that works with modern application stacks

## Components Overview

SysManix consists of several key components:

- **API Server**: The core HTTP server that handles requests
- **Authentication System**: Manages users, roles, and permissions
- **Service Handlers**: Platform-specific implementations for Windows and Linux
- **Configuration System**: Flexible configuration with sensible defaults
- **Logging Framework**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit trails
